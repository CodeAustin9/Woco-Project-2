# Project-2-WOCO

## Getting Started

### NPM Installations

Run the following command lines in the terminal:

- `npm install express`
- `npm install body-parse`
- `npm install path`
- `sequelize init:models & sequelize init:config`
  - If you get an error, then you may not have the sequelize and the sequelize-cli installed globally. Fix this by running `npm install -g sequelize sequelize-cli` in your         terminal and trying again. Navigate to the config folder, open `config.json`, and modify the development object's "database","username" and "password" values to match your MYSQL database on your machine. Include the database port number, if not using the default.

### Deployment 

* To check if the server is listening, navigate to the root of the project. In the terminal command line, run `node server.js`. This will display a message "Listening on PORT: 8080.

* Then open your browser and type "localhost: 8080". This will display the home page and allow you to navigate through the site. 

* Alternatively, you can go directly to site by pasting the following link in your browser (hosted by Heroku): https://arcane-lake-35500.herokuapp.com.
